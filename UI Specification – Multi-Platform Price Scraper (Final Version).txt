🎨 UI Specification – Multi-Platform Price Scraper (Final Version)

For UI/UX Designer – Full Requirements

1️⃣ Default View (Before Scraping)

The landing layout is simple, clean, and minimal:

Top Input Section

A single large input bar

Placeholder: “Paste product URL…”

On the right side (inline), a primary “Scrape” button

Both elements are centered, with a modern SaaS look (soft shadows, rounded edges)

This top bar is the hero element of the default state.

2️⃣ Results View (After Scraping)

Once user clicks Scrape, show:

📌 Product Image

A large product image displayed on the left side

Keep aspect ratio clean, good padding, soft card background

3️⃣ Price Comparison Containers

On the right side of the product image, show multiple platform cards:

Platform Cards (Displayed Only If Data Found)

Amazon — Container 1

Flipkart — Container 2

Myntra — Container 3

(Ajio optional, not mandatory)

Each platform container must include:

Platform logo + name

Price

Availability

Rating (star-based)

View Product button

Very important rule:

If a platform has no data, DO NOT show its container.
Only show containers for platforms where the scraping succeeded.

4️⃣ Dynamic “Scraped Platforms” Buttons

After scraping, directly under the search bar, a new horizontal button group appears.

Example:

If data found on Amazon & Flipkart →
Show two buttons:

Amazon

Flipkart

If only Amazon → Only Amazon button appears
If three → Show all three

Purpose:

When the user clicks one of these buttons →
Show detailed product information from that specific platform.

5️⃣ Detailed Product View (After Clicking Platform Button)

This section appears below the price containers.

Detailed view includes:

Large product image

Full product description

Product details/specifications

Any additional metadata from the scraper

Clean, readable layout with spacing

This is like an “expanded view” per platform.

💎 Professional Description for UI Designer (Final Draft)

Below is the polished version you can send directly to a designer:

📝 UI/UX Brief – Multi-Platform Price Scraper Dashboard

The goal is to design a clean, modern, and intuitive interface for a web tool that scrapes a product URL and shows prices across multiple e-commerce platforms.

1. Default State

A minimal layout featuring:

One central product URL input field

A “Scrape” button aligned to the right of the input

Balanced spacing and a light, modern SaaS theme

This is the primary call-to-action before any data is loaded.

2. Scrape Result Layout

Once the user performs a scrape:

Left Section

Large product image displayed in a soft-card container

Right Section

A vertical list of platform price cards

Only show the platforms where data exists

Amazon

Flipkart

Myntra

Each card contains:

Platform logo + title

Price

Availability

Star rating

“View Product” button

Containers should be clean, consistent, and visually distinct.

3. Scraped Platforms Filter Buttons

Directly below the search bar:

Dynamically generated buttons based on successful platforms

Example:

If product found on Amazon + Flipkart → show those two buttons only

These buttons let users switch views between platform-specific details

4. Detailed Product Information Panel

When a platform button is clicked:

Show a detailed view containing:

Larger product image

Full product description

Product details/specifications

The layout should resemble a clean, readable product page section

The content updates based on the selected platform

Overall Themes

Light mode

Blue + white base palette

Rounded corners, soft shadows

Clean typography (e.g., Inter, Poppins, SF Pro)

Layout must feel modern, spacious, and easy to scan

No clutter; focus on clarity and usability
